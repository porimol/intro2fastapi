## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing purposes and as well as in production machine.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Prerequisite

> Before you start, make sure you have a installed [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/)


### How do I get set up?

Clone the code repository.

```python
git clone git@github.com:porimol/intro2fastapi.git

cd intro2fastapi
poetry install
```

### Model Training

To training the model, run the following command.

```bash
python intro2fastapi/models/training.py
```
Once, model training successfully done, the pickled model will be stored in `intro2fastapi/models/` folder.

### API Serving

Run the following command to serving API.

```bash
poetry run uvicorn intro2fastapi.api:app --reload
```

Now, see the console and you will get the output something like following.

```bash
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/Users/opt/intro2fastapi']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [33179] using StatReload
INFO:     Started server process [33205]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```
